            I am green with gooseflesh, rashes on my lobes dripping pink into the mouth in the gravel. Ten thousand cubits before I crawl my abrasions across the pantheon to watch the dying nymphs lick the seed of the tree trunks, retching, coughing, spilling bile on sterile cement, piling bugs like stones until the chitin catches fire mocking the skyless above in ablaze totems of perishing prosthetics. The container betrays its scarce excuses of life in peaks through the plaster. The walls are groaning. Pearls embedded in the corridor fall and melt into pools burning scars into the ground becoming conduits that sprout flagellated ghostly apparitions that wave in dismissal of my state, every mechanism uncaring of my stagnant decline of fate becomes participant in my persecution. The glue makes my forearms itch with inflammation, constricting and dilating over and under my tissues in an alien respiratory rhythm, pulling my membrane into its own, getting it close enough to tearing it, maybe really rupturing every part of it, combining it with its own chemical nature in confusing asymmetry. I hear the walls start to shriek. The shrillness impales my ossicles in unforgiving continuity until my consciousness gives in and I snap into white

            I walked down to the ____________ this morning. they wouldnt let me take my arms so one of the watchmen politely took them off as the other clumsily reached for the receptacles stashed in the cabinet below his desk. once I was rid of my offending appendages the lock lady scurried from behind the copse of deformed conifers to accompany me outside into the rainswept loggia circuiting the canals, glistening obsidian meandering across little turns- sharp and blunt- the ceiling, or whatever seemed to be left of it- was a crocheted mess of naked edges, hollow crevices stretching and shooting eyes into the sky, the edges holding them rugged, with stretches of straight stoic geometry interrupted with the walls arching into sudden curt smiles then resuming their heartless linearity. The locklady, an ancient tenant of this monstrosity and perchance more familiar with its contours, seemed to be scanning across the scene with as much wonder as her company, save the occasional brief head turn to register my presence. About a tenth of our way to the outers, or maybe it was twelve - my intuitive compass had been worn off his usual confidence by time and reprogramming - I could make out the humming diffusing along the corridor, ricocheting off the dampness into a disfigured hymn. The noises of the frownsmen, laughing? Weeping? I did not have an inkling. Marinating in reluctant pensiveness in my quarantined state back at the quarters, I had started to negotiate with myself the privilege of my circumstances, or maybe the lack thereof. I was divided. Had gilded walls coaxed me into a comfy imprisonment. Had I been the captive? Or was it the frownsmen? Were we both coincidentally on reflecting sides of the same predicament? Who was the captor? Was it circumstance? Was it one another? How was I to reconcile with the ambiguity of my part in imprisonment myself? What am I walking into? Where do these corridors take me? Could I afford indifference beyond the next couple steps? Suddenly my mind pulled down leather draped walls around itself until no one snaking thought could make its escape unto more troubling speculations. "Indifferent it is, then."

            I blinked open one mucus clad iris after the next at the skies, slate grey with pastel smudges of lilac and vermillion fragmented with fiery blasts of potassium flames flaring across the timid proportions of humidity in garish trapeze stunts. The moon snarled in her sleep, eyes half closed, fluttering, baring her yellowing teeth to stick out her tongue to lick the abrasions on her cheek. Forgiving my own brief betrayal of attention from a cycle of urgent rest derivation, I resumed in my paralysis with as much stillness as the moment would let me muster. There were no songs of the frownsmen to be heard here, only the vanquished weeping of the sky, soft pattering over hard soil giving way to polyphonic gargling dissipating from the heaving heart in the hells that was cruel enough to germinate these twisted ciliations looking vainly to their mothers above like guileless stillbirths in the fixed greying image of dearth and empty under the shelter of moistening eyes. Green was a myth. Entity even farther in the way of fantasies. Everything a mangled mirage spitting gravel into the snarling gash in the parachute of stardust. I was just a parasite living within a parasite living within a parasite resenting the parasite living within me until my leeching trunk split apart into filaments and broke into little spores that flew away in the wind, brushed over and across the sniffling countenance of a shrieking banyan, then swirling into the milky pond like fireflies in a porcelain palm. I had tried to grasp any meaning this stonefaced calamity of isolation around me had and yet right where I had my fingers a few clockspins before, life shooting phalange to phalange with bubbling corpuscles, splashing plasma, warmth and person, there was now only the feeling of something that was and might never be again.

            The griefminister stands on a platform, an elephantine trunk draped in chainmail along the upper half and somewhere turning into a malformed appendage of leprous foliations with wet soil and corroded ores wrestling into ambiguity with grey climbers and spiky filaments all the way to the mound of cracked concrete bragging defiance to earthly inertia as old rocks jitter and shift over the bubbling goo that engulfs their predecessors like primordial incubators. The griefminister frowns with his lips, leaving gaps with tar-smeared teeth peeking out. He clasps his plate firmly, anxiously, proudly. The tiny stone on his brow diffracts the negative light that coils around the mausoleum. His shaven head oddly complementing the uterine arches of the ceiling in the best built structure in fevershine. "No expense was spared", as they said. A flurry of crowbats spiral above in dizzying sinusoidal synchronicity, hurling up translucent puke in thin threads raining it over the greyfolk. They don't mind it, they have grown used to it.

            To the general,
                Tilling a fickle line on the coarse alluvium hugging my feet, I write to tell you one and many things.
                I was distraught when the sewer broke, when the cattle fled, when the wet gorge stuffed in the corner of my abundant home became uneasy on the eyes and spat me out into the outers.
                There was no green to be seen here.
                No moths with pink and olive embroidery.
                No pigeons, no storks, no forked river nor swimming ferns and blue tailed macaez.
                In this dearth I walked.
                For walking was all I knew.
                The great valleys fatigue my ankles as every few miles the earth pushes her dark breasts up as if to woo me out of my tragedy.
                I have exhausted my grain. 
                I look for faces that look like mine but my neck hurts from turning my head fruitlessly quite so often.
                I hope to make it to your door some day, if you have managed to retain yours from them.
                Or if you could find it in yourself to welcome me;
                After what I am about to tell you.
                I have been putting it off talking about grief and hurt and flies and follies.
                But I really do need to tell you

                I have the breath of the stricken.
                I went to the house.
                I saw my caricature dance in madness and run herself into a nail in the wall.
                Saw the blood dry.
                I found a trap door.
                I found the things bound in rope, found the satchel of jute, the hat with their names on it, my torn dress, ripped to rags except the buttons and the blouse, and a little brown postcard sewn into the hem, a mural of ugly death and a hatchet propped up on the wall beside to go along with it.
                I took your bones before i sunk into my grave.
                Auth(o)r praises me.
                The tar-veined bastard bribed me with a book of flesh, every leaf a sliver of you hanging off the spine with hardened glue, congealed blood, the foam around your dying smile fossilized into crystal globes along the pages.
                My remorse knows no earthly bounds. I am sorry,
                But I was hungry,
                And you were more dead than I ever had been.
                Look where that got me.

            The author sits in a cold room with four walls and no door, bulbous phalanges bending and angling across one another in a brittle lattice of parched skin, propping up the ink pot against one chafed knee. He coughs up a gob of phlegm, granular and metallic to taste. He sees the bloodlake boiling in the shadow of the moon with every brief intermission from the disintegrating white that the blink of an eye offers. Bloodlake timid, bloodlake bright. Bloodlake pungent. A crooked margin of vegetation, a vertebral descent of sizeless breathing clusters of forest green and beige conversing, as if quite violently in quiet violence, with the formidable contours of the purples and the greys. He finds these to be an exit point to a necessary illusion, shrinking the hot white lines burned into his retinal wall to attain an ironic congruence with the cornices looming over him on the upper edges of his white cell, the only hint of curvature bestowed upon an otherwise cubical confinement of nothingness. Sterility burnt so deep in his marrow that thought, desire, release, pain, all that clogged up into one putrid entanglement in the corner of the cell would repel the darnedest of lonesome fantasies. A green spot fluttering in the far side of his periphery like a reminder of machinic tenacity forging its own brand of self absorbed determination in his precious sight. He longs for water. Water that tasted like blood the last time he could afford a sip of it. Now his lungs have spikes, his alveoli engorged in an ugly shade of violet melting in a pond of decay in the valley of his soul. His neck itches though the thick belt of steel and leather. A sardonic twist of fate that could even make the clouds break into laughter; the only covered part of him was the one craving the most attention. He did not remember what it is that he would call his own before the conclusion started. The conclusion was all he had. All he remembered of his identity. All he remembered of his purposelessness. All he could muster in that hollow vessel in his skull to mean anything of human consciousness. He was deprived, of everything that could make him, that had made him, or that was brought upon him by his maker. He had no scriptures tucked under a sheath of skin, nor did the braille of rashes and gooseflesh along the coldness of his thighs convey anything of meaningful reconciliation. Submitting to the throbbing ache in his thumb, he finally lets go of his pen, stashes the pot in a broken cabinet protruding from the wall, and brings his eyes to a close.

            Warm flesh for you scoundrels, I got a boat full! Dagger dancing on the shore like the lord's jester, the lines of copper strained across the starboard beams boasted long wide drapes of red and brown. Fresh meat. Got the scavengers prowling with their raw reddened cocks peeking through the plumage like flaming turrets. A gash in the low hanging clouds flowed a flagrant purple across the immense canopy of rotten boughs and twisted branchlets. Geyser basins drool into the open palm of the valley, abrasions etched in sediments that lay bare the untold fortune of three universes, the globe and its sister, and the mother that turned away. When you see the faces sunk into the walls, brow deep, like clumps of mold with fretting creases, it reminds every fold of your skin to twitch to the soft jingle of the wind against the hanging cutlery. The kitchen betrays a warm contrast against the cold world flooding your senses: mud bowls with roots poking through the holes and cracks, some hint of green, but mostly ceramic freckled with grey and brown, grieving cycles worth of autumnal departure. The furniture is all human. Dying flesh and bones hardened into the unfathomable geometry of commodity. Somebody drew an uneven circle on the wall, a cross inside and each end of the cross diverging into six curved lines making a flower, a shield and an eye, all contained within that contorted circumference. Dead dogs pant no more, but the mother remebers putting food on the pan. So she goes on, morsels after dollops after morsels after mounds. Fevershine looks pretty with the dreams shifting on the bed of the lagoons, the floor had eyes until the chariots scraped them off, the blood oozed and clotted and dried into little knots that rolled and tumbled and drank from the roots of the tallest trees until they were leveled into the soil and rinsed by the storms. Delicate hands ran across the fields, brushing pollen off the anthers, husk off the grains, a smile off the ever present dastardly drunkenness of the black mud. The iron seeps into the water here, irrigators have filters but they do no good, the red elixir of death trickles into little pipettes and gets breathed in by the young greens germinating, then sprayed up to the bloodied sky to mix with the clouds. I have no hand to hold when I look up, only the itch of thirst bothering my tonsil. Of who I am, I have heard many a tale. Of who to trust, I know naught. Of all the answers, I carried with me but little.        </div>
